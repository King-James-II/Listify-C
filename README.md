# Listify

Listify is a program that allows users to create, manipulate, and store items in a linked list. It provides options to add, remove, search, import, and export list items, as well as print the list to the screen.

## Features

- **Add & Remove Items:** Add or remove items from the list, both at the front and the end.
- **Search & Print:** Search for items within the list and print the entire list to the screen.
- **Import & Export:** Import items from a text file into the list or export items from the list to a text file.

## Programming Concepts Used

- **Linked Lists:** Utilizes linked lists to store and manage items efficiently.
- **File I/O:** Reads from and writes to text files for importing and exporting list items.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures correct data entry through input validation techniques.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Manages memory for nodes in the linked list using dynamic memory allocation.
- **Modularization:** Organizes the program into functions for better organization and reusability.
- **Control Flow:** Employs control flow constructs like loops and conditional statements for menu navigation and program execution.
